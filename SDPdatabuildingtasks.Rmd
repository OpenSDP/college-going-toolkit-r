# SDP Data Building Tasks


## Introduction

### SDP DATA BUILDING GUIDE

\normalsize
Congratulations on identifying the data elements that are essential for 
conducting rigorous analyses in your organization. **Clean** is the next stage 
in the SDP Toolkit for Effective Data Use.  To successfully move through the 
**Clean** stage, you should review the  **Identify** component of this toolkit.  

Upon completing this stage, you will have produced clean research files that 
will allow you to **Connect** and **Analyze** data related to college-going 
success in your agency.

#### The Tasks

**Clean** consist of five tasks that share a similar structure.  The tasks are 
geared toward analysts with at least moderately strong data background and 
comfort with statistics.  Each task provides hands-on experience building 
specific components of the research file used for the SDP CollegeGoing 
Diagnostic Analyses.

The tasks are listed as follows:

- Task 1: Student Attributes
- Task 2: Student School Year
- Task 3: Identifying the Ninth Grade Cohort
- Task 4: Student School Enrollment
- Task 5: Student Test Scores
- Task 6: Student Class Enrollment
- Task 7: NSC (National Student Clearinghouse) Data

Each task uses a raw input file and produces a cleaned
output file that matches Identify. 

Download these raw input files along with everything else
you need for the toolkit as a zip file at www.gse.harvard.edu/sdp/toolkit. When unzipped, this file will reveal an
infrastructure including all the steps of the toolkit, the data
files you need, and template files with R code.

In particular, in Clean, you will be working with the files in the **raw** 
folder. If you are using R, you can fill in the corresponding `.R` scripts
in **programs** to go through the tasks.

#### How to Start

The beginning of the Data Building Guide is a Decision
Rules Glossary (p. 6). This glossary provides decision rules
for resolving data problems associated with particular
variables. It is meant to be a quick-reference guide of
rules that can be used with any software platform. These decision rules are then implemented in the step-by-step
instructions the tasks provide.

SDP has also created a detailed **SDP R Glossary**,
available as a separate document, that covers the R
commands used throughout the toolkit. Commands are
listed alphabetically and by subject.

As you go through a task, be sure to consult the data and code
snippets to get a visual sense for the changes occurring at each step.


#### Task Structure

The tasks follow a logical sequence from **1** to **7**. Each task
comes with its own raw input file that results in a cleaned
output file that matches or extends the file **Identify**. We
also provide all cleaned output files so you can check your
answers after completing each task. If you have followed the
task instructions correctly, you should arrive at the same
cleaned output file.

In each task, you will also find:

- **Purpose:** --- Clarifies the importance of the task.  
- **How to Start:** --- Identifies the input file(s) for the task.
- **Data Description:** --- Describes data elements for the task.
- **Instructions:** --- Provides instructions to transform data. 
  These instructions include: 
    
    - R code to help you execute the instructions through code
    - Data snapshots to help you visaulize changes to the data at each step

#### Summary

Through the tasks, you will learn effective practices
for: data transformation, variable construction, and
implementation of key decision rules.
The **Task Map** on the next page summarizes the inputs
and outputs of each task and how the outputs are used in
**Connect** to produce an analysis file. The Task Map also
serves as a Table of Contents.
If you need additional guidance, the friendly research team at
SDP is available to help: **sdp@gse.harvard.edu**.

#### Task Map

This map summarizes the inputs and outputs for each task and how the outputs 
are used in Connect to produce the collegegoing analysis and college-going 
analysis on-track file.

## Decision Rules Glossary

Should this be added?

## Task 1: STUDENT ATTRIBUTES

### PURPOSE

In **Task 1: Student Attributes**, you will take the `Student_Demographics_Raw` 
file and generate the clean `Student_Attributes` file that matches the 
specification in **Identify** with one observation per student.

The core of this task:

  1. Create consistent gender indicators for students across years.
  2. Create consistent race/ethnicity values for students across years.
  3. Create consistent values for high school diploma indicators.

### HOW TO START

To begin, open the `Student_Demographics_Raw` file in R. If you do not have R, 
you can follow the steps of the task by looking at the instructions and data
snippets we have provided.

If this is your first time attempting **Task 1**, start with the provided raw 
input file. This file teaches you SDP’s cleaning methodology and allows you to 
check answers from a common dataset.

```{r environmentSetup, echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA}
# Set options for R code output
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment=NA, warning=FALSE, 
                      error=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE,
                      fig.align='center')
# Set R output width to render nicely
options(width=80)
```

### DATA DESCRIPTION

The clean `Student_Attributes` file includes `sid`, `male`, `race_ethnicity`,
`first_9th_school_year_reported`, `hs_diploma`, `hs_diploma_date`, and 
`hs_diploma_type`. Later analyses do not currently make use of birth dates and 
zip codes, and these variables are thus excluded. This file contains the 
combined `race_ethnicity` variable rather than separate variables for race 
and ethnicity.

The raw input file, `Student_Demographics_Raw`, varies from the clean 
`Student_Attributes` file in a number of ways. In `Student_Demographics_Raw`, 
`race_ethnicity` is coded as a string rather than numeric and does not 
distinguish between the designations multiple, 
"M", and other, "O". `Student_Demographics_Raw` is also a time-variant data 
set including `school_year` so the data is unique by `sid` and `school_year`.
`Student_Attributes`, however, is unique by `sid` alone. The aim of this
task will be to match `Student_Attributes` to be unique by `sid` only.


#### Uniqueness 

Some agencies may record **race_ethnicity** and/or **gender** 
each school year. Alternatively, students may have multiple records for having 
attended ninth grade or multiple diploma dates and/or types. To fix this issue, 
you will create a `Student_Attributes` research file unique by `sid` alone starting 
from a `Student_Demographics_Raw` file that is unique by `sid` and `school_year`. 
Once the file is unique by `sid` as shown in **Identify**, it is ready for **Connect**.

#### Step 0: Load and Inspect the Data

```{r, loadRequiredPackages}
## Step 0: Load the packages and prepare your R environment

library(tidyverse) # main suite of R packages to ease data analysis
library(magrittr) # allows for some easier pipelines of data

# Read in some R functions that are useful for toolkit tasks, see SDP R Glossary
# for details

source("R/functions.R")
library(haven) # required for importing .dta files
```



```{r readStudentDemogFile, echo=TRUE}
## Step 0: Load the college-going analysis file into Stata
## using the haven library

# To read data from a zip file and unzip it in R we can 
# create a connection to the path of the zip file
# To read data from a zip file we create a connection to the path of the 
# zip file

tmpfileName <- "raw/Student_Demographics_Raw.dta"

# This assumes analysis is a raw subfolder from where the file is read, 
# in this case inside the zipfile

con <- unz(description = "data/raw.zip", filename = tmpfileName, 
           open = "rb")

# The zipfile is located in the subdirectory data, called raw.zip

stuatt <- read_stata(con) # read data in the data subdirectory
close(con) # close the connection to the zip file, keeps data in memory
```


```{r inspectTheData}
glimpse(stuatt)
head(stuatt)
```


```{r checkUniqueness}
# Checks that number of unique values of `sid` equals number of rows
# A quick way to test this in R
nvals(stuatt$sid) == nrow(stuatt) #nvals function is in functions.R
```

Now drop the `first_9th_school_year_reported` variable. You will create a 
`first_9th_school_year_reported` variable in Task 3 that also imputes this 
variable for transfer-ins. 

```{r dropFirst9th}
# In R one way to drop a variable is by assigning it a NULL value
stuatt$first_9th_school_year_reported <- NULL
# For testing purposes, let's specify a variable which indexes the SIDs 
# we will use to check our work
idx <- c(2, 8552, 12506) # Specify which SIDs are interesting
# Now we can easily view only relevant data
stuatt[stuatt$sid %in% idx,]
```

#### Step 1: Create one consistent value for gender across years

```{r inspectMaleVariable}
# Create one consistent value for gender for each student across years
# View the data

stuatt %>% arrange(sid, school_year) %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, male) %>% 
  filter(sid %in% idx)
```

Create a variable that shows how many unique values `male` assumes for each 
student. Name this variable `nvals_male`. Tabulate the variable and browse 
the relevant data.


```{r countUniqMale}
# Step 1: Create an intermediate variable that counts the number of unique 
# values observed for `male` per student

stuatt <- stuatt %>% group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(nvals_male = length(unique(male))) %>% ungroup() 
table(stuatt$nvals_male)

# Look at the values where more than one value is observed
stuatt %>% select(sid, school_year, male, nvals_male) %>% 
  filter(nvals_male > 1) 

# Or interactively in RStudio
# stuatt %>% select(sid, school_year, male, nvals_male) %>% 
#   filter(nvals_male > 1) %>% View
```

Identify the modal gender. If multiple modes exist for a student, report the 
most recent gender recorded.

```{r modalGender}
# Step 2: Identify the modal gender, if multiple modes exist, report the most 
# recent gender

# Here is an example mode function in R taht mimics Stata
# We can read this function in or load it from another package
# library(eeptools)
# statamode creates a list of the modal values and assigns NA, missing,
# if more than one mode exists

statamode <- function(x) {
  z <- table(as.vector(x))
  m <- names(z)[z == max(z)]
  if(length(m) == 1){
    if(class(x) %in% c("numeric", "integer", "logical")){
      class(m) <- class(x)
    } else {
      class(m) <- "character"
    }
    return(m)
  }
  return(NA)
}

# Apply statamode to the data grouped by sid
stuatt <- stuatt %>% group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(nvals_male = length(unique(male)), 
         male_mode = statamode(male)) %>% ungroup() 

# Check our work
stuatt %>% select(sid, male, male_mode, nvals_male) %>% 
  filter(sid %in% idx)

# Replace male with male_mode where male_mode is not missing
# In R we replace by vector so both sides of the <- have to have the same filter 
# so they are the same length, otherwise R will recycle the elements on the 
# right hand side and we will have the wrong values in place
stuatt$male[!is.na(stuatt$male_mode)] <- 
  stuatt$male_mode[!is.na(stuatt$male_mode)]
```

```{r multipleModes}
idx <- c(8552, 12506)

stuatt %>% select(sid, school_year, male, nvals_male, male_mode) %>% 
  filter(sid %in% idx)


# If multiple modes exist, report the most recent gender recorded
stuatt %<>% arrange(sid, school_year) %>% 
  group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(temp_male_last = male[school_year == max(school_year)])

# Show sid 12506
stuatt %>% select(sid, school_year, male, nvals_male, male_mode, temp_male_last) %>% 
  filter(sid == 12506)

# Assign temp_male_last to the male variable in cases where no mode exists
stuatt$male[is.na(stuatt$male_mode)] <- stuatt$temp_male_last[is.na(stuatt$male_mode)]

# Check our work again
stuatt %>% select(sid, school_year, male, nvals_male, male_mode, temp_male_last) %>% 
  filter(sid == 12506)
# Drop temporary variables
stuatt %<>% select(-nvals_male, -male_mode, -temp_male_last)
```

Now check our work

```{r verifyGender}
table(stuatt$male)

# Check nvals without creating the variable
stuatt %>% ungroup %>% 
  group_by(sid) %>% 
  summarize(nvals = nvals(male)) %>% select(nvals) %>% 
  table

nvals(stuatt$sid)

```


##### Step 2: Create one consistent value for race_ethnicicty for each student across years

Recode the raw `race_ethnicity` variable as a numeric variable and label it. 
Replace the string race_ethnicity variable with the numeric one.

- 1 = African American, not Hispanic
- 2 = Asian American
- 3 = Hispanic
- 4 = American Indian
- 5 = White, not Hispanic
- 6 = Multiple / Other

```{r raceEthnicityRecode}
# When R reads in Stata files using haven it creates a data type called 
# labelled, for compatibility with Stata and most R functions, we convert 
# this into a more standard factor variable

# Create a copy
stuatt$race_num <- stuatt$race_ethnicity
stuatt$race_ethnicity <- as_factor(stuatt$race_ethnicity)
table(stuatt$race_ethnicity) #check current values

stuatt$race_num <- NA
stuatt$race_num[stuatt$race_ethnicity=='B'] <- 1
stuatt$race_num[stuatt$race_ethnicity=='A'] <- 2
stuatt$race_num[stuatt$race_ethnicity=='H'] <- 3
stuatt$race_num[stuatt$race_ethnicity=='NA'] <- 4
stuatt$race_num[stuatt$race_ethnicity=='W'] <- 5
stuatt$race_num[stuatt$race_ethnicity=='M/O'] <- 6
table(stuatt$race_num)

idx <- c(8552)

stuatt %>% filter(sid %in% idx) %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, race_ethnicity, race_num)

```

```{r raceFactorconstruction}
# If the data were not coming from Stata, we would need to create a factor 
# variable ourselves
# In R categorical variables are best represented as factors
# Factors can have values, order, and labels
# Create a labeled factor for the new race_num variable
stuatt$race_num2 <- factor(stuatt$race_num, 
                           labels = c('Black', 'Asian', 'Hispanic', 
                                    'Native American', 'White', 'MultipleOther'))

# Compare them to check using a cross-tabulation
table(stuatt$race_ethnicity, stuatt$race_num2)
# Replace them
stuatt$race_ethnicity <- stuatt$race_num2
stuatt$race_num2 <- NULL

table(stuatt$race_ethnicity) # counts
prop.table(table(stuatt$race_ethnicity))*100 #percentages
```

Check:  What does the distribution of your `race_ethnicity` variable look like? 
Let's redraw the tables above in a more readable format.

```{r prettyTable, results="markup"}
library(pander) # library to beautify output
pander(prop.table(table(stuatt$race_ethnicity))*100, style = "rmarkdown")
pander(table(stuatt$race_ethnicity), style = "rmarkdown")
```

Let's also draw a figure to show this distribution.

```{r prettyGraph, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2) # the best R library for plotting

qplot(stuatt$race_ethnicity,geom='bar') + 
  theme_classic() + labs(x = 'Race/Ethnicity', y = 'Count', 
                    title = "Frequency of Student Race")
```

Create a variable indicating how many unique values `race_ethnicity` 
assumes for each student called `nvals_race`.

```{r nvalsRace}
# Create a variable indicating how many unique values `race_ethnicity` takes 
# for each student

stuatt <- stuatt %>% group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(nvals_race = nvals(race_ethnicity))

table(stuatt$nvals_race)
```

Create a variable that shows how many unique values `race_ethnicity` 
assumes for each student and `school_year`. Name this variable `nvals_race_yr`. 
Tabulate the variable and browse the relevant data.

```{r nvalsRaceYear}
# Create a variable that shows how many unique values `race_ethnicity` 
# assumes for each student and school year. 

stuatt <- stuatt %>% group_by(sid, school_year) %>% 
  mutate(nvals_race_yr = nvals(race_ethnicity))

#Make a table
table(stuatt$nvals_race_yr)

# Browse the results
stuatt %>% select(sid, school_year, race_ethnicity, nvals_race, nvals_race_yr) %>%
  filter(nvals_race_yr > 1)
```


If more than one race is reported in the same `school_year`, report students as 
multiracial, unless one of their reported `race_ethnicity` values is Hispanic. 
Report the student as Hispanic in that case.

```{r multiracialLabel}
# Generate a temporary hispanic variable
# Use ifelse function to recode variable

stuatt$temp_ishispanic <- ifelse(stuatt$race_num == 3 & 
                                   stuatt$nvals_race_yr > 1, 1, 0)

stuatt %>% select(sid, school_year, race_ethnicity, nvals_race, 
                  nvals_race_yr, temp_ishispanic) %>%
  filter(nvals_race_yr > 1)

# Take the maximum value of temp_ishispanic by student by school_year
# This is creating a variable indicating if the student was ever 
# listed as hispanic in a given school year

stuatt %<>% group_by(sid, school_year) %>% 
  mutate(ishispanic = max(temp_ishispanic, na.rm=TRUE))

stuatt %>% select(sid, school_year, race_ethnicity, nvals_race, nvals_race_yr, 
                  temp_ishispanic, ishispanic) %>%
  filter(nvals_race_yr > 1)

# Replace hispanic values
stuatt$race_num[stuatt$nvals_race_yr > 1 & stuatt$ishispanic == 1] <- 3
stuatt$race_ethnicity[stuatt$nvals_race_yr > 1 & stuatt$ishispanic == 1] <- "Hispanic"
stuatt$race_num[stuatt$nvals_race_yr > 1 & stuatt$ishispanic != 1] <- 6
stuatt$race_ethnicity[stuatt$nvals_race_yr > 1 & stuatt$ishispanic != 1] <- "MultipleOther"

# Drop the temporary variables
stuatt <- select(stuatt, -ishispanic, -temp_ishispanic)

# Drop the duplicates resulting from fixing student with different race_ethnicity
# within a school year

# bind_rows allows us to bind two data frames with the same columns together
# The first data.frame will be all rows where the student-school_year race 
# is consistent
# The second data.frame is all rows where student race varies by school_year, 
# but we have corrected it and drop all duplicated rows using the distinct 
# command

#NROW 87534
stuatt <- bind_rows(stuatt %>% filter(nvals_race_yr < 2), 
                    stuatt %>% filter(nvals_race_yr > 1) %>% 
                      distinct(sid, school_year, race_ethnicity, .keep_all=TRUE))
stuatt <- select(stuatt, -nvals_race_yr)

# Re arrange after binding the rows
stuatt %<>% arrange(sid, school_year)
```

```{r checkwork}
# Before we fixed the data we had 87534 rows
# We had 3 students with 2 different races, so we had 6 rows where we needed 3
# This means we had 3 extra rows

nrow(stuatt) == 87534 - 3
```


Report the modal race. If multiple modes exist for a student, report the most 
recent race recorded.

```{r modalRace}
# Calculate the modal race for a student over time, if multiple modes exist
# report the most recent
stuatt %<>% group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(race_mode = statamode(race_ethnicity))

# tab1 <- table(modes$race_temp,modes$nvals)
# addmargins(tab1, FUN=list(Total=sum), quiet=TRUE)

stuatt %>% filter(sid == 8552) %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, race_ethnicity, nvals_race, race_mode)

stuatt$race_ethnicity[!is.na(stuatt$race_mode)] <- stuatt$race_mode[!is.na(stuatt$race_mode)]

stuatt %>% filter(sid == 8552) %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, race_ethnicity, nvals_race, race_mode)

# Consider cases where the mode is not unique
stuatt %>% filter(sid == 2) %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, race_ethnicity, nvals_race, race_mode)

```

Find the most recent race.

```{r mostRecentRace}
# Define the most recent value of race observed
stuatt %<>% group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(race_last = race_ethnicity[school_year == max(school_year)])

stuatt %>% filter(sid == 2) %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, race_ethnicity, nvals_race, race_mode, race_last)

stuatt$race_ethnicity[is.na(stuatt$race_mode)] <- stuatt$race_last[is.na(stuatt$race_mode)]

stuatt %>% filter(sid %in% c(8552, 2)) %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, race_ethnicity)

# Drop temporary variables
stuatt %<>% select(-nvals_race, -race_mode, -race_last, -race_num)
```

Check your work.

```{r raceTableFinal}
table(stuatt$race_ethnicity)
```

#### Step 3: Create consistent values for high school diploma variables

Recode the `hs_diploma_type variable` as a numeric variable and label it.
Replace the string `hs_diploma_type` variable with the numeric one. Use lower
numbers for more competitive diploma types.

```{r convertDipltoFactor}
# 1. Recode the `hs_diploma_type variable` as a numeric variable and label it.
# Replace the string `hs_diploma_type` variable with the numeric one. Use lower
# numbers for more competitive diploma types.

# In R a factor variable behaves like a labeled numeric variable in Stata
# When reading the data in from a .dta file we can recover the numeric 
# labels and ordering by using the `as_factor` function
stuatt$dipl_num <- as_factor(stuatt$hs_diploma_type)
```

```{r longRecodeDiploma}
# To show the work this saves if the data has already been labeled in Stata, 
# the alternative method for manually recreating this is shown below
stuatt$dipl_num <- 4
stuatt$dipl_num <- ifelse(stuatt$hs_diploma_type == "College Prep Diploma", 
                          1, stuatt$dipl_num)
stuatt$dipl_num <- ifelse(stuatt$hs_diploma_type == "Standard Diploma", 
                          2, stuatt$dipl_num)
stuatt$dipl_num <- ifelse(stuatt$hs_diploma_type == "Alternative Diploma", 
                          3, stuatt$dipl_num)

stuatt %>% select(sid, school_year, hs_diploma, hs_diploma_date, 
                  hs_diploma_type, dipl_num) %>% 
  filter(sid == 16)

stuatt$hs_diploma_type <- NULL
stuatt$hs_diploma_type <- stuatt$dipl_num
stuatt$dipl_num <- NULL

stuatt %>% select(sid, school_year, hs_diploma, hs_diploma_date, 
                  hs_diploma_type) %>% 
  filter(sid == 16)
```


Identify the first diploma date reported

```{r firstDiplomaDate}
# Now identify the first diploma date reported
stuatt %<>% arrange(sid, hs_diploma_date)

stuatt %<>% group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(earliest_diploma_date = min(hs_diploma_date, na.rm=TRUE))

stuatt %>% select(sid, school_year, hs_diploma, hs_diploma_date, 
                  hs_diploma_type, earliest_diploma_date) %>% 
  filter(sid == 16)
```

Create a variable that shows the earliest diploma type

```{r firstDiplomaType}
# Create a variable that shows the earliest diploma type
# This statement is extra long and includes the mode because it needs to avoid 
# ties in the earliest diploma date
stuatt %<>% group_by(sid) %>%
 mutate(earliest_dipl_type_mode = statamode(hs_diploma_type[hs_diploma_date==earliest_diploma_date]))


stuatt %>% select(sid, school_year, hs_diploma, hs_diploma_date, 
                  hs_diploma_type, earliest_diploma_date, earliest_dipl_type_mode) %>% filter(sid == 16)
```

Create a variable that shows the number of unique diploma types recorded 
for the first diploma date


```{r uniqDiplomaTypeCount}
# Number of unique diploma types for the first diploma date
stuatt %<>% group_by(sid) %>%
 mutate(nvals_dipl_type = 
          length(unique(hs_diploma_type[hs_diploma_date==earliest_diploma_date])))

stuatt %>% select(sid, school_year, hs_diploma_type, earliest_diploma_date, 
                  earliest_dipl_type_mode, nvals_dipl_type) %>% 
  filter(sid %in% c(16, 20, 80))
```

Identify the modal diploma type. If multiple modes exist for a student, report 
the diploma type in the earliest school year for the first diploma date

```{r modalDiplomaType}
# 5. Identify the modal diploma type. If multiple modes exist for a
# student, report the diploma type in the earliest school year for 
# the first diploma date

stuatt %<>% group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(earliest_dipl_type_syear = hs_diploma_type[school_year == min(school_year)])


stuatt %>% select(sid, school_year, hs_diploma_type, earliest_diploma_date, 
                  earliest_dipl_type_mode, nvals_dipl_type, 
                  earliest_dipl_type_syear) %>% 
  filter(sid %in% c(16, 20, 80))


stuatt %<>% group_by(sid) %>%
  mutate(earliest_dipl_type_syear_mode = statamode(earliest_dipl_type_syear))

stuatt %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, hs_diploma_type, earliest_diploma_date, 
                  earliest_dipl_type_mode, nvals_dipl_type, 
                  earliest_dipl_type_syear, 
         earliest_dipl_type_syear_mode) %>% 
  filter(sid %in% c(16, 20, 80))

```


If multiple diploma types were recorded for the same school year and first 
diploma date, report the most competitive diploma type

```{r pickMostCompetitiveDiploma}
# 6. If multiple diploma types were recorded for the same school year and first 
# diploma date, report the most competitive diploma type

#### Step 4: Drop any unneeded variables, drop duplicates, check the data, and save the file

```{r cleanStuattnSave}

```


## Task 2: STUDENT SCHOOL YEAR

### PURPOSE

In **Task 2: Student School Year**, you will take the `Student_Classifications_Raw` 
file and generate a clean `Student_School_Year` output file that matches the
specification in Identify with one observation per student and school year. To 
do so, you will first ensure only one grade level is assigned per student per 
school year. Then, you will process the free or reduced price lunch (FRPL)
variable (a proxy for students’ poverty status), individualized education 
program (IEP) variable, English language learner (ELL) variable, and gifted 
variable. You will also examine the total days enrolled, days absent, and 
days suspended variables. 

The core of this task:

1. Resolve instances when students have more than one grade level in a school
year
2. Keep the highest value of FR PL reported by student by school year
3. If a student has both “has IE P” and “no IE P” reported in a school year, 
keep "has IEP"
4. If a student has both "has ELL" and "no ELL"" reported in a school year, 
keep "has ELL"
5. If a student is observed as both gifted eligible and not eligible, report 
eligible
6. Explore `days_enrolled`, `days_absent` and `days_suspended`
7. Drop duplicate observations to make the file unique by student and school 
year 

After this, you will have a data set unique by student and school year 
that allows you to assign students to the appropriate ninth grade cohort in 
**Task  3**.

### HOW TO START

To begin, open the `Student_Classifications_Raw` file in R. If you do 
not have R, you can follow the steps of the task by looking at the 
instructions and data snippets we have provided.

If this is your first time attempting **Task 2**, start with the provided raw 
input file. This file teaches you SDP’s cleaning methodology and allows you to 
check answers from a common dataset.

#### Step 0: Load the Student_Classifications_Raw data file

```{r loadStuClassFile}
# Read in Stata
library(haven) # required for .dta files

# To read data from a zip file we create a connection to the path of the 
# zip file
tmpfileName <- "raw/Student_Classifications_Raw.dta"
con <- unz(description = "data/raw.zip", filename = tmpfileName, 
           open = "rb")
stuclass <- read_stata(con) # read data in the data subdirectory
glimpse(stuclass)
```

#### Step 1: Create one consistent grade level for each student within the same year

Keep the highest `grade_level` when a student has multiple grade levels within 
the same year

```{r consistentGradeYear}
# Keep the highest grade_level when a student has multiple grade levels 
# within the same year

# distinct values function
nvals <- function(x){
  length(unique(x))
}


varIdx <- c("sid", "school_year", "grade_level", "nvals_grade", 
            "max_grade_level")

stuclass %<>% group_by(sid, school_year) %>% 
  mutate(nvals_grade = nvals(grade_level), 
         max_grade_level = max(grade_level))


stuclass %>% select(one_of(varIdx)) %>% 
  filter(sid == 3)

stuclass$grade_level[stuclass$nvals_grade > 1] <- stuclass$max_grade_level[stuclass$nvals_grade > 1]

stuclass %>% select(one_of(varIdx)) %>% 
  filter(sid == 3)


stuclass %<>% select(-nvals_grade, -max_grade_level)

```

#### Step 2: Create one consistent FRPL value for each student in the same student-year

Recode raw `frpl` variable with string type to numeric type

```{r recodeFrpl}
# Recode raw frpl variable with string type to numeric type

stuclass$frpl_num <- NA
stuclass$frpl_num[stuclass$frpl == "N"] <- 0
stuclass$frpl_num[stuclass$frpl == "R"] <- 1
stuclass$frpl_num[stuclass$frpl == "F"] <- 2

stuclass %>% select(sid, school_year, grade_level, frpl, frpl_num) %>% 
  filter(sid == 80)


stuclass$frpl <- NULL
stuclass$frpl <- stuclass$frpl_num
stuclass$frpl_num <- NULL

stuclass %>% select(sid, school_year, grade_level, frpl) %>% 
  filter(sid == 80)
```

Ensure that `frpl` is consistent by `sid` and `school_year`. In cases where 
multiple values exist, report the highest value. Follow the same procedure 
as Step 1 for `grade_level`.

```{r frplConsistentStuYear}
# 2. Ensure that frpl is consistent by sid and school_year. In cases where 
#  multiple values exist, report the highest value. Follow the same procedure 
#  as Step 1 for grade_level.

# Check if there are any cases where different values of frpl status are reported
#  in a year

stuclass %<>% group_by(sid, school_year) %>% 
  mutate(nvals_frpl = nvals(frpl))

table(stuclass$nvals_frpl)

# Report the highest value of frpl by year for each student, selecting 
# free over reduced over not participating

stuclass %<>% group_by(sid, school_year) %>% 
  mutate(highest_frpl = max(frpl))

stuclass$frpl <- stuclass$highest_frpl

# Label the values so they are easy to understand

# drop the temporary values we created

stuclass %<>% select(-nvals_frpl, -highest_frpl)

```


#### Step 3: Create one consistent IEP value for each student within the same year

```{r iepConsistStuYear}
# Follow the same procedure as Step 1 for grade_level.
# Report the highest value of iep by year for each student, 
#  selecting has iep over not iep.

stuclass %<>% group_by(sid, school_year) %>% 
  mutate(highest_iep = max(iep)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(iep = highest_iep) %>% 
  select(-highest_iep)
```

#### Step 4: Create one consistent ELL value for each student within the same year

```{r ellConsistStuYear}
# Follow the same procedure as Step 1 for grade_level.

# // Report the highest value of ell by year for each student, selecting is ell over not ell.

stuclass %<>% group_by(sid, school_year) %>% 
  mutate(highest_ell = max(ell)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(ell = highest_ell) %>% 
  select(-highest_ell)
```

#### Step 5: Create one consistent gifted value for each student within the same year

```{r gtConsistStuYear}
# Follow the same procedure as Step 1 for grade_level.

# // Report the highest value of gifted by year for each student, selecting is enrolled in gifted program over not enrolled.

stuclass %<>% group_by(sid, school_year) %>% 
  mutate(highest_gifted = max(gifted)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(gifted = highest_gifted) %>% 
  select(-highest_gifted)

```

#### Step 6: Drop any unneeded variables, drop duplicates, and save the file

```{r stuclassCleannSave}
# Drop duplicate observations

stuclass <- stuclass[!duplicated(stuclass),]

# Make sure your file is now unique by student and school year

nrow(stuclass) == nvals(paste0(stuclass$sid, stuclass$school_year))

# Save the current file as Student_School_Year.dta which you will need for Task 3.


# dir.create("clean")
# save(stuclass, file = "Student_School_Year.rda")
# Or if you want to save the Stata file
# write_dta(stuclass, file = "clean/Student_Attributes.dta")

# Clean up the workspace
rm(con, tmpfileName, stuclass, varIdx)
```


## Task 3: IDENTIFYING THE NINTH-GRADE COHORT

### PURPOSE

In **Task 3**: Identifying the Ninth Grade Cohort, you will identify the school 
year students first appear in ninth grade using the clean 
`Student_School_Year` research file from **Task 2**. This essential step allows 
you to form student cohorts and examine longitudinal college-going outcomes.

The core of this task:

1. Flag the first school year a student enrolls in grades 9, 10, 11, or 12.
2. Identify the school year in which the student was first observed in 9th
grade.
3. Impute the school year in which transfer students would have been in grade 9.
4. Replace the first_9th_school_year_observed with the correctly imputed values.

After completing this task, you will have a clean `Student_School_Year` file that
identifies first-time ninth graders. This file is used both to assemble the
analysis file in **Connect** and to complete **Task 4**.

### HOW TO START

To begin, open the `Student_School_Year` file, just created in **Task 2**, in R.
*Note if you are doing this in one sitting you can just keep it in your workspace.*
If you do not have R, you can follow the steps of the task by looking at 
the instructions and data snippets we have provided. 

If this is your first 
time attempting **Task 3**, start with the cleaned output file from **Task 2**. 
This file teaches you SDP’s cleaning methodology and allows you to check 
answers from a common dataset.

### DATA DESCRIPTION

The input file in this case, `Student_School_Year`, also the output from **Task 2**,
now follows the structure of `Student_School_Year` in **Identify** so it is 
unique by `sid` and `school_year`. The aim of this task will be to create a 
`first_9th_school_year_observed` variable using the variables in the file.

#### Uniqueness 

This dataset was cleaned in **Task 2** and is now unique by `sid` and `school_year`.

#### Step 0: Load the Student_School_Year data file

```{r readStuSchYear}
# Read in Stata
library(haven) # required for .dta f;iles

# To read data from a zip file we create a connection to the path of the 
# zip file
tmpfileName <- "clean/Student_School_Year.dta"
con <- unz(description = "data/clean.zip", filename = tmpfileName, 
           open = "rb")
stusy <- read_stata(con) # read data in the data subdirectory
glimpse(stusy)
```

#### Step 1: Flag the first school year a student enrolls in grades 9, 10, 11, or 12

```{r flagFirstYearbyGrade}
# Create four binary indicators to flag the first school year a student enrolls in grades 9, 10, 11, or 12.

stusy %>% filter(sid == 1) %>% select(sid, school_year, grade_level)

stusy %<>% group_by(sid, grade_level) %>% 
  mutate(tmpG = ifelse(school_year == min(school_year), 1, NA),
         observed_g = 1)

stusy %>% filter(sid == 1) %>% select(sid, school_year, grade_level, 
                                      tmpG, observed_g)

# Use tidyr to spread first_flag and observed_g out into multiple indicator 
# variables
library(tidyr)
stusy$first_flag <- stusy$grade_level
stusy <- spread(stusy, key = first_flag, value = tmpG, sep = "") %>% 
  select(-one_of("first_flag3", "first_flag5", "first_flag6", "first_flag7", 
                 "first_flag8", "first_flag13", "first_flag17"))
stusy$observed <- stusy$grade_level

# Fill in a 1 because we want the observed vectors to populate all values 
# for a student
stusy <- spread(stusy, key = observed, value = observed_g, sep = "_") %>% 
  select(-one_of("observed_3", "observed_5", "observed_6", 
                 "observed_7", "observed_8", "observed_13", 
                 "observed_17")) %>% 
  group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(observed_9 = max(observed_9, na.rm=TRUE), 
         observed_10 = max(observed_10, na.rm=TRUE), 
         observed_11 = max(observed_11, na.rm=TRUE), 
         observed_12 = max(observed_12, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(observed_9 = ifelse(is.finite(observed_9), 1, 0),
         observed_10 = ifelse(is.finite(observed_10), 1, 0),
         observed_11 = ifelse(is.finite(observed_11), 1, 0),
         observed_12 = ifelse(is.finite(observed_12), 1, 0))

# Check how many students are identified as enrolled in grades 9, 10, 11, or 12

# Create a temporary dataframe of only the variables we are interested in for 
# tabulation
tmp <- stusy %>% 
  select(num_range(prefix= "observed_", range = 9:12)) %>% 
  distinct(.keep_all=TRUE)

table(tmp$observed_9)
table(tmp$observed_10)
table(tmp$observed_11)
table(tmp$observed_12)

rm(tmp) # remove our temporary data, note the original data will stay
```

#### Step 2: Identify the school year in which the student was first observed in 9th grade

```{r identifyFirstSYg9}
# Create a variable that lists the first school year a student is observed as 
# enrolled in grade 9.

stusy %<>% group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(first_9th_schyear_obs = min(school_year[grade_level == 9]))

# If a student has no values of school_year where grade_level ==9 then 
# R will assign this a value of infinite, which is slightly different 
# than missing

# work around weird way R handles minimum of an empty vector
stusy$first_9th_schyear_obs[!is.finite(stusy$first_9th_schyear_obs)] <- NA

# Check data
stusy %>% filter(sid == 1) %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, grade_level, first_flag9, observed_9, first_9th_schyear_obs)

stusy %>% ungroup %>% distinct(sid, first_9th_schyear_obs) %>% 
  select(first_9th_schyear_obs) %>% unlist %>% table


# Say something about missing values in the list...

```

#### Step 3: Impute the school year in which transfer students would have been in grade 9

```{r imputeSchYearforTransfer}
# Impute first_9th_school_year_observed as school_year - 1, school_year - 2, or
# school_year - 3 for students first observed in 10th, 11th or 12th grade 
# as transfer-ins

stusy$first_flag10[!is.finite(stusy$first_flag10)] <- 0
stusy$first_flag11[!is.finite(stusy$first_flag11)] <- 0
stusy$first_flag12[!is.finite(stusy$first_flag12)] <- 0

stusy$tempfirst9year <- ifelse(stusy$first_flag10 == 1, 
                               stusy$school_year - 1, 
                               ifelse(stusy$first_flag11 == 1, 
                               stusy$school_year - 2, 
                               ifelse(stusy$first_flag12 == 1, 
                               stusy$school_year - 3, 
                               NA)))

stusy %>% filter(sid == 2) %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, grade_level, first_9th_schyear_obs, 
         tempfirst9year)

# What is up with 2003 in the table here in Stata documentation

stusy %<>% group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(tempfirst9year = min(tempfirst9year, na.rm=TRUE))

stusy$first_9th_schyear_obs[is.na(stusy$first_9th_schyear_obs) & !is.na(stusy$tempfirst9year)] <- stusy$tempfirst9year[is.na(stusy$first_9th_schyear_obs) & !is.na(stusy$tempfirst9year)]

stusy$tempfirst9year <- NULL

#

Review the distribution of `first_9th_school_year_observed` for students who 
transferred in grades 10-12


```{r checkfirst9thwTable}
# Review the distribution of first_9th_school_year_observed for students who 
# transferred in grades 10-12

stusy %>% ungroup %>% 
  filter(first_flag10 > 0) %>% 
  filter(observed_9 == 0) %>% 
  distinct(sid, first_9th_schyear_obs) %>% 
  select(first_9th_schyear_obs) %>% unlist %>% table


stusy %>% ungroup %>%

  distinct(sid, first_9th_schyear_obs) %>% 
  select(first_9th_schyear_obs) %>% unlist %>% table

```

#### Step 4: Adjust the imputation of first_9th_school_year_observed for students who appear in a lower grade in a later school year

Flag students who are observed to be in a lower grade in a subsequent 
school year.

```{r flagGradeSequences}
# Flag students who are observed to be in a lower grade in a subsequent 
# school year.

stusy %<>% arrange(sid, school_year) %>%

  mutate(grade_flag_max = max(grade_flag, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  select(-grade_lag)


stusy %>% select(sid, school_year, grade_level, 
                 first_9th_schyear_obs, grade_flag, grade_flag_max) %>% 
  filter(sid == 3) 

```

Flag the first school year in which students appear in high school grades

```{r flagFirstHSgrade}
# Flag the first school year in which students appear in high school grades

stusy %<>% group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(first_9th_flag = ifelse(school_year == min(school_year[grade_level %in% c(9:12)]), 1, 0))

## Or if you want to save the Stata file
# write_dta(stusy, file = "clean/Student_School_Year_Ninth.dta")

# Clean up the workspace
rm(con, tmpfileName, stuclass, varIdx)

## Task 4: STUDENT SCHOOL ENROLLMENT

### PURPOSE

In Task 4: Student School Enrollment, you will take the `Student_School_Enrollment_Raw`
file and generate the `Student_School_Enrollment` file that matches the
specification in **Identify**. After matching **Identify**, you will take your 
dataset a few steps further by consolidating overlapping enrollment spells and
determining thelast withdrawal code for each student to yield the file
`Student_School_Enrollment_Clean`.

The core of this task:

1. Create a `school_start` and `school_end` variable.
2. Remove abnormal enrollment observations with missing enrollment and 
withdrawal dates along with enrollment or withdrawal dates that are not in the 
right order.
3. Consolidate overlapping enrollments by student by school.
4. Update `days_enrolled` based on the consolidated enrollments using the new 
enrollment and withdrawal dates.  
5. Determine the last withdrawal code for each student. You will use this data 
in later analyses to determine a student’s end of high school outcomes.

After completing this, you will have a clean `Student_School_Enrollment` file. 
This process sets up our analyses for high school graduation and college enrollment
and persistence outcomes.

### HOW TO START

To begin, open the `Student_School_Enrollment_Raw` file in R. If you do not 
have R, you can follow the steps of the task by looking at the instructions and
data snippets we have provided.

If this is your first time attempting **Task 4**, start with the provided input 
file. This file teaches you SDP’s cleaning methodology and allows you to check 
answers from a common dataset.

#### Step 0: Load the Student_School_Enrollment_Raw data file

```{r readStuEnrFile}
# Step 0: Load the Student_School_Enrollment_Raw data file
# Read in Stata
library(haven) # required for .dta f;iles

# To read data from a zip file we create a connection to the path of the 
# zip file
tmpfileName <- "raw/Student_School_Enrollment_Raw.dta"
con <- unz(description = "data/raw.zip", filename = tmpfileName, 
           open = "rb")
stuenr <- read_stata(con) # read data in the data subdirectory
glimpse(stuenr)
```

#### Step 1: Create a school_start and school_end variable

```{r createSchoolStartEnd}
## Step 1: Create a school_start and school_end variable
## In this example, school start is August 1, and school end is July 31 of 
## each school year. This may be different in your agency.

library(lubridate) # handle dates and times in R correctly

stuenr$school_start <- mdy(paste0("08", "01", stuenr$school_year-1))
stuenr$school_end <- mdy(paste0("07", "31", stuenr$school_year))

## - Caution - ##
## In R we have to create a character string that we convert to a date
## Converting numerics to dates and times can introduce errors
## - Caution - ##
```

#### Step 2: Remove abnormal enrollment observations

```{r cleanAbnormalEnroll}
## Step 2: Remove abnormal enrollment observations. 

# Drop observations missing both enrollment and withdrawal dates.
stuenr %<>% filter(!is.na(enrollment_date) & !is.na(withdrawal_date))

# Drop observations with enrollment and withdrawal dates on same day.
stuenr %<>% filter(!enrollment_date == withdrawal_date & !is.na(enrollment_date))

# Drop observations with withdrawal date earlier than enrollment date.

stuenr %<>% filter(!is.na(withdrawal_date) & !withdrawal_date < enrollment_date)

# Drop observations with enrollment date after the end of the current school year.

stuenr %<>% filter(school_end > enrollment_date)

# Drop observations with enrollment date before the beginning of the current 
# school year.

stuenr %<>% filter(school_start <= enrollment_date)

# Drop observations with withdrawal date more than one month after the end 
# of the school year.

stuenr %<>% filter(withdrawal_date <= (school_end + 31) & !is.na(withdrawal_date))

# Check to make sure enrollment dates are in the correct school year.

table(stuenr$enrollment_date >= stuenr$school_start)
table(stuenr$enrollment_date <= stuenr$school_end)

```

#### Step 3: Consolidate overlapping enrollments by student by school

```{r consolidateOverlapEnrollment}
# Sort enrollment spells in ascending order and then check how many overlapping
# enrollment spells exist for a student at the same school.

stuenr %<>% arrange(sid, school_code, enrollment_date)

stuenr %<>% group_by(sid, school_code) %>% 
  mutate(lag_withdrawal_date = lag(withdrawal_date)) %>% ungroup %>% 
  group_by(sid, school_code, school_year) %>% 
    mutate(min_enroll_date = min(enrollment_date))

 table(stuenr$enrollment_date <= stuenr$lag_withdrawal_date & 
         !is.na(stuenr$lag_withdrawal_date))
# 682?
# 
# tmp <- stuenr %>% filter(sid == 2) %>% 
#   select(sid, school_year, school_code, enrollment_date, 
#          enrollment_code_desc, withdrawal_date, lag_withdrawal_date,
#          withdrawal_code_desc, min_enroll_date)

## For overlapping observations, replace the enrollment date and enrollment code
## description of all but the first enrollment spell with the earliest enrollment 
## date

stuenr$enrollment_date[stuenr$enrollment_date <= stuenr$lag_withdrawal_date & 
                         !is.na(stuenr$lag_withdrawal_date)] <- stuenr$min_enroll_date[stuenr$enrollment_date <= stuenr$lag_withdrawal_date & 
                         !is.na(stuenr$lag_withdrawal_date)]

stuenr %>% filter(sid == 2) %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, school_code, enrollment_date, 
         enrollment_code_desc, withdrawal_date,
         withdrawal_code_desc)
## Replace the withdrawal date and withdrawal code description of the earliest
## enrollment spell with the latest withdrawal date.

# Sort the data first so that latest withdrawal
# information appears as the first record.

stuenr %<>% arrange(sid, school_code, enrollment_date, withdrawal_date)

stuenr %>% filter(sid == 2) %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, school_code, enrollment_date, 
         enrollment_code_desc, withdrawal_date,
         withdrawal_code_desc)

# Replace withdrawal_date
# Replace withdrawal_code_description

stuenr %<>% group_by(sid, school_code, enrollment_date) %>%
  mutate(withdrawal_date = last(withdrawal_date), 
         withdrawal_code_desc = last(withdrawal_code_desc))

```

#### Step 4: Update days_enrolled based on the consolidated enrollments using the new enrollment and withdrawal dates

```{r updateDaysEnrolled}

stuenr$days_enrolled <- stuenr$withdrawal_date - stuenr$enrollment_date

stuenr %>% filter(sid == 2) %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, school_code, enrollment_date, 
         enrollment_code_desc, withdrawal_date,
         withdrawal_code_desc, days_enrolled)
```

#### Step 5: Determine the last withdrawal code for each student. You will use this data in later analyses to determine a student's end of high school outcomes

```{r determineLastWithdrawalCode}

stuenr %<>% arrange(sid, withdrawal_date)

stuenr %>% filter(sid == 16) %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, school_code, enrollment_date, 
         enrollment_code_desc, withdrawal_date,
         withdrawal_code_desc)

stuenr %<>% group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(last_withdrawal_reason = last(withdrawal_code_desc))

stuenr %>% filter(sid == 16) %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, school_code, enrollment_date, 
         enrollment_code_desc, withdrawal_date,
         withdrawal_code_desc, last_withdrawal_reason)
```

### Step 6: Drop any unneeded variables, drop duplicates, and save the file

```{r cleanStuEnrandSave}
## Drop duplicate records

stuenr %<>% select(-min_enroll_date, -lag_withdrawal_date)
stuenr <- ungroup(stuenr) %>% distinct(sid, school_year, school_code, 
                                    enrollment_date, .keep_all = TRUE)

## Confirm that file is unique by student, school_year, school_code, 
## and enrollment_date

nvals(paste0(stuenr$sid, stuenr$school_year, stuenr$school_code, 
             stuenr$enrollment_date)) == nrow(stuenr)

## Save the current file as Student_School_Enrollment_Clean

## Make directory and save
# dir.create("clean")
# save(stuenr, file = "clean/Student_School_Enrollment_Clean.rda")
## Or if you want to save the Stata file
# write_dta(stuenr, file = "clean/Student_School_Enrollment_Clean.dta")

rm(tmp, stuenr); gc()
```


## Task 5: STUDENT TEST SCORES

### PURPOSE

In **Task 5:** Student Test Scores, you will take the `Student_Test_Scores` 
file, containing data on all the tests a student has taken and matching the
structure of **Identify**. Through this task, you will generate three different 
clean output files that contain a single score and test-taking instance for
each student:

- Prior Achievement (one 8th grade state test score per student),
- SAT scores (one SAT score per student), and
- ACT scores (one ACT score per student).

The file for Prior Achievement will contain students’ achievement on state 
standardized Math and English Language Arts tests in 8th grade. This will allow 
you to control for prior academic achievement when you examine college-going 
outcomes. The SAT and ACT score files will be used for defining highly qualified 
high school graduates.

The core of this task:

- Prior Achievement
  1. Clean state test scores and resolve instances where students took the same 
  test multiple times.
  2. Standardize test scores to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This 
  allows you to compare across tests and years when different score scales were
  used.
  3. Generate a composite math and English score for scaled and standardized 
  test scores in eighth grade.
- SAT
  1. Clean SAT test scores and resolve instances where students took the same 
  test multiple times.
  2. Generate a total SAT score based on math, verbal, and writing scores.
- ACT
  1. Clean ACT test scores and resolve instances where students took the same 
  test multiple times.

After completing this, you will have a Prior_Achievement file with 8th grade 
test scores. You will also have SAT and ACT files. All three files will be used 
in **Connect**.

### HOW TO START

To begin, open the `Student_Test_Scores` file in R. This file contains data on 
State assessments, SAT, and ACT scores. If you do not have R, you can follow
the steps of the task by looking at the instructions and data snippets we have 
provided.

If this is your first time attempting **Task 5**, start with the provided input 
file. This file teaches you SDP’s cleaning methodology and allows you to check 
answers from a common dataset.

### DATA DESCRIPTION

The input file, `Student_Test_Scores`, follows the structure of 
`Student_Test_Scores` in Identify so it is unique by `sid`, `test_code`, and 
`test_date`. The aim of this task will be to create three separate clean output 
files, Prior_Achievement, SAT, and ACT, that report only one test score per 
student. This means that for eight grade prior achievement duplicates of the 
same test taken in the same and different years will need to be resolved. Also 
any duplicates of SAT or ACT scores will need to be resolved as well.

#### Uniqueness

Prior Achievement (8th grade state test scores).

Ideally, state test data in its raw form is unique by `sid`, `test_subject`,
`grade_level`, and `school_year`. However, some students re-take the same test 
for the same grade in the same year. To fix this, you will make the 8th grade 
test score data in `Student_Test_Scores` unique by `sid`, `test_subject`, 
`grade_level`, and `school_year` by removing any same year repeat test taking 
instances. Then, you will manipulate the data so tests for different subjects in 
the same `grade_level` fall on the same row so the data is unique by `sid`, 
`test_subject`, and `grade_level`. As a final step, if a student took the same 
test in different years (e.g. by repeating a grade), you will take the earliest
instance. The data will finally be unique by `sid` and is considered a clean file 
and ready to be incorporated into the analysis file in **Connect**.

SAT

Ideally, SAT test data in its raw form is unique by `sid`. However, some students
re-take the SAT. To fix this, you will take the data unique by `sid`, 
`test_subject`, and `test_date` and reshape it so the data will finally be 
unique by `sid` and is considered a clean file and ready to be incorporated into 
the analysis file in **Connect.**

ACT

Ideally, ACT test data in its raw form is unique by `sid`. However, some 
students re-take the ACT. To fix this, you will take the data unique by `sid`,
`test_subject`, and `test_date` and reshape it so the data will finally be 
unique by `sid` and is considered a clean file and ready to be incorporated 
into the analysis file in **Connect**.

#### Part I: Clean Prior Achievement Scores

#### Step 0: Load the Student_Test_Scores data file

```{r readstutest}
# Read in Stata
library(haven) # required for .dta f;iles
# To read data from a zip file we create a connection to the path of the 
# zip file
tmpfileName <- "raw/Student_Test_Scores.dta"
con <- unz(description = "data/raw.zip", filename = tmpfileName, 
           open = "rb")
stutest <- read_stata(con) # read data in the data subdirectory
close(con)
# Convert to R style
stutest$test_subject <- as_factor(stutest$test_subject)
stutest$test_subject <- tolower(as.character(stutest$test_subject))
glimpse(stutest)
```

#### Step 1: Keep only the variables you need and limit the sample to state test scores in 8th grade

```{r dropVarsTest}
## Keep only the variables you need and limit the sample to state test scores 
## in 8th grade.

statetest <- stutest %>% 
            select(sid, test_type, test_subject, school_year, 
                   grade_level, scaled_score, raw_score, test_date) %>% 
    filter(test_type == "State" & grade_level == 8)

# Leave the original stutest, we will come back to this later. In R 
# we can keep multiple datasets open in the workset at the same time.
```

#### Step 2: Clean up raw and scaled scores

```{r cleanupScaledScores}
## Clean up raw and scaled scores.
## Change raw and scaled scores to missing if zero.

# A forloop in R
for(var in c("raw_score", "scaled_score")){
  statetest[, var][statetest[,var] == 0] <- NA
}

# Drop observations missing both a raw and scaled test score.
statetest %<>% filter(!is.na(raw_score) | !is.na(scaled_score))
```


#### Step 3: Identify same-year repeat test takers and take the highest test score
```{r identifyRepeatTests}
## Identify same-year repeat test takers and take the highest test score
## For ties in scores, take the last date tested

statetest %<>% arrange(sid, test_subject, 
                       grade_level, school_year, scaled_score)

statetest %>% filter(sid == 595) %>% 
  select(sid, test_type, school_year, test_date, grade_level, 
         test_subject, scaled_score, raw_score)

statetest %<>% group_by(sid, test_subject, school_year, grade_level) %>% 
  mutate(keep_flag = scaled_score == max(scaled_score) & 
           test_date == max(test_date)) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  filter(keep_flag) %>% 
  select(-keep_flag)

statetest %>% filter(sid == 595) %>% 
  select(sid, test_type, school_year, test_date, grade_level, 
         test_subject, scaled_score, raw_score)

# Verify that each student has only one state test in a
# subject in a school year.

statetest %>% distinct(sid, test_subject, grade_level, school_year) %>%
  nrow == nrow(statetest)
```

#### Step 4: Reshape the data so math and ELA tests appear on the same row

```{r reshapeELAMathWide}
## Reshape the data so math and ELA tests appear on the same row.
statetest <- reshape(as.data.frame(statetest), 
               v.names = c("raw_score", "scaled_score"), 
               timevar = c("test_subject"), 
               idvar = c("sid", "test_type", "test_date",
                         "school_year", "grade_level"),
               direction = "wide", 
               sep = "_")
```

#### Step 5: Compute standardized test scores with mean 0 and standard deviation 1

```{r scaleAndCenterScores}
## Compute standardized test scores with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
statetest$scaled_math_std <- scale(statetest$scaled_score_math)
statetest$scaled_ela_std <- scale(statetest$scaled_score_ela)

statetest %>% select(scaled_math_std, scaled_ela_std) %>% 
  na.omit %>% summary
```

#### Step 6: Identify different-year repeat test takers and take the earliest test score

```{r giveRepeatersEarlyScore}
## Identify different-year repeat test takers and take the earliest test score.

## In R we can do this all at once using group_by
statetest %<>% group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(keep_flag = test_date == min(test_date)) %>% 
  filter(keep_flag) %>% select(-keep_flag)
```


#### Step 7: Verify that each student has only one state test, and drop unneeded variables.

```{r verifyAndDrop}
## Verify that each student has only one state test, and drop unneeded variables
nrow(statetest) == nvals(statetest$sid)
statetest %<>% select(-test_date, -test_type)

```


#### Step 8: Generate composite scaled and standardized scores that average ELA and math scores

```{r genCompositeStateTest}
## Generate composite scaled and standardized scores that average ELA and 
## math scores.
statetest$scaled_score_composite <- (statetest$scaled_score_ela + statetest$scaled_score_math) /2
statetest$scaled_score_composite_std <- (statetest$scaled_math_std + statetest$scaled_ela_std) /2

```

#### Step 9: Save the current file as Prior_Achievement.dta.

```{r saveCleanStuTestState}
## Save the current file as Prior_Achievement.dta.

statetest %<>% arrange(sid, school_year, grade_level) %>% 
  select(sid, school_year, grade_level, raw_score_math, raw_score_ela,
         scaled_score_math, scaled_score_ela, scaled_score_composite,
         scaled_math_std, scaled_ela_std, scaled_score_composite_std)

## Make directory and save
# dir.create("clean")
# save(statetest, file = "clean/Prior_Achievement.rda")
## Or if you want to save the Stata file
# write_dta(statetest, file = "clean/Prior_Achievement.dta")

rm(tmp, statetest); gc()
```


#### Part II: Clean SAT Scores

The steps here are condensed because the process is very similar to the process 
for state assessment scores.

```{r SATscores}
## Keep only the variables and limit the sample to SAT.
sattest <- stutest %>% filter(test_type == "SAT")
sattest %<>% select(sid, test_subject, test_date, scaled_score)

## Drop duplicate observations and any observations missing test scores.
sattest %<>% distinct()
sattest %<>% filter(!is.na(scaled_score))

## Reshape the data so that math, ELA, and writing scores appear on one row 
## by student and test date.
sattest <- reshape(as.data.frame(sattest), 
               v.names = c("scaled_score"), 
               timevar = c("test_subject"), 
               idvar = c("sid", "test_date"),
               direction = "wide", 
               sep = "_")

## Rename for convenience
names(sattest) <- c("sid", "sat_test_date", "sat_math_score", 
                    "sat_verbal_score", "sat_writing_score")
sattest %<>% arrange(sid, sat_test_date)

## Identify repeat test takers and take the earliest test score.

sattest %<>% group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(keep_flag = sat_test_date == min(sat_test_date)) %>% 
  filter(keep_flag) %>% select(-keep_flag)

## Verify that the file is now unique by student.
nrow(sattest) == nvals(sattest$sid)

## Verify that test scores from the component subjects are not missing and 
## generate total scores.

table(!is.na(sattest$sat_math_score) & !is.na(sattest$sat_verbal_score))
sattest$sat_total_score <- sattest$sat_math_score + sattest$sat_verbal_score

table(!is.na(sattest$sat_math_score) & !is.na(sattest$sat_verbal_score) & 
        !is.na(sattest$sat_writing_score))

sattest$sat_total_score_plus_writing <- sattest$sat_math_score +
  sattest$sat_verbal_score + sattest$sat_writing_score

## Save the current file as SAT.dta.

## Make directory and save
# dir.create("clean")
# save(sattest, file = "clean/SAT.rda")
## Or if you want to save the Stata file
# write_dta(sattest, file = "clean/SAT.dta")
rm(sattest); gc()
```

#### Part III: Clean ACT Scores 

Steps are condensed because of their similarity to the steps above.


```{r actScoreClean}
## Keep only the variables you need and limit the sample to ACT.
acttest <- stutest %>% filter(test_type == "ACT")
acttest %<>% select(sid, test_subject, test_date, scaled_score)

## Identify repeat test takers and take the earliest test score.

acttest %<>% group_by(sid) %>% 
  mutate(keep_flag = test_date == min(test_date)) %>% 
  filter(keep_flag) %>% select(-keep_flag)

## Keep and rename the relevant variables.
acttest %>% select(sid, test_date, scaled_score)
names(acttest) <- c("sid", "act_test_date", "act_composite_score")

## Verify that the file is now unique by student.
nrow(acttest) == nvals(acttest$sid)

## Save the current file as ACT.dta.
## Make directory and save
# dir.create("clean")
# save(acttest, file = "clean/ACT.rda")
## Or if you want to save the Stata file
# write_dta(acttest, file = "clean/ACT.dta")
rm(acttest); gc()
```

## Task 6: STUDENT CLASS ENROLLMENT

### PURPOSE

In **Task 6:** `Student Class Enrollment`, you will take the `Class_Raw` file 
and the `Student_Class_Enrollment` file to create the 
`Student_Class_Enrollment_Merged` file that combines these two files together. 
The combined file will identify a unique observation by student and class id. 
To obtain this file, you will first clean the `Class_Raw` file to identify core 
courses in math and ELA based on the course description variable and match the
specification in **Identify**. This will make the class file unique by class id. 
Second, you will merge the Class file and the Student Class Enrollment file and 
make it unique by student id and class id.

The core of this task:

1. Using the Class file:
  a. Drop incomplete observations
  b. Flag core math and English courses based on the course description
2. Merging the Student Class Enrollment file:
  a. Merge the Class file onto the `Student_Class_Enrollment_Raw` file
  b. Evaluate course marks and drop courses with no record of completion
  c. Evaluate course enrollment so that each student has only one enrollment 
  record for a course

The `Student_Class_Enrollment_Merged` file will be used in **Connect** to create
on-track indicators for students. On-track indicators explore year-by year
academic progress towards high school graduation and college readiness. For 
instance, using course credit and course grade information, one might ask what 
percent of students earn the minimum number of credits in their core courses to 
satisfy agency graduation requirements?

### HOW TO START 

To begin, open the `Class_Raw` file in R. This file contains data linking 
students to teachers. If you do not have R, you can follow the steps of the 
task by looking at the instructions and data snippets we have provided. In the 
second part of this task, you will then use the `Student_Class_Enrollment` file.
If this is your first time attempting **Task 6**, start with the provided input 
file. This file teaches you SDP’s cleaning methodology and allows you to check 
answers from a common dataset.

### DATA DESCRIPTION FOR RAW FILE 

The input file, `Class_Raw`, varies from Class in **Identify** in a number of 
key ways. Most importantly, the data is not unique by `cid` as shown in 
**Identify**. For instance, there may be more than one course description that 
describes the same course. Also, a `tid` is not included as it is not required 
for the questions later asked in this toolkit. Support for a `Class` file with 
`tid` will come with the Human Capital version of the toolkit. The aim of this 
task then is to eliminate any duplicate course code descriptions and match the 
`Class` file in **Identify** in its structure and uniqueness so it is unique by 
`cid` alone.

#### Uniqueness

The input file, Student_Class_Enrollment_Raw, follows the structure of Student_Class_Enrollment in Identify so it is unique by sid, cid, and class_enrollment_
date. The aim of this task then is to take things one step further by consolidating any overlapping enrollment spells for the same student and cid.



#### Part I: Clean the Class File

#### Step 0: Load the Class_Raw data file

```{r readStuClass}
# Read in Stata
library(haven) # required for .dta f;iles

# To read data from a zip file we create a connection to the path of the 
# zip file
tmpfileName <- "raw/Class_Raw.dta"
con <- unz(description = "data/raw.zip", filename = tmpfileName, 
           open = "rb")
classRaw <- read_stata(con) # read data in the data subdirectory
close(con)
glimpse(classRaw)

tmpfileName <- "raw/Student_Class_Enrollment.dta"
con <- unz(description = "data/raw.zip", filename = tmpfileName, 
           open = "rb")
stuclass <- read_stata(con) # read data in the data subdirectory
close(con)
glimpse(stuclass)

```

#### Step 1: Identify the critical variables that identify a class

```{r filterandSelectClassData}
## Identify the critical variables that identify a class.

local_ids <- c("cid", "school_year", "school_code", "section_code", 
                     "course_code")
## Drop the observations where any of the critical variables are missing
classRaw %<>% 
  filter(complete.cases(.[, local_ids]))

```

#### Step 2: Flag core math and English courses

Note that agencies may have varying consistency in course names and use 
different criteria to identify a core course vs an elective.

In some cases, other criteria may have to be applied to identify core courses 
(e.g. the department the course is # listed in, or length of the course.)

We provide a simplified version of the cleaning process for the class file: 
work within your agency to determine the best criteria.

```{r flagMathandEngCourses}
## Tabulate course names
table(classRaw$course_code_desc)

## Flag math courses based on the tabulation results
## Generate a flag variable
classRaw$math_flag <- NA

## Use the grep function to identify course names that contain common word 
## stems, but slightly different spellings, e.g.Algebra I and Algebra-I

## In R the patterns need to have no spaces in the grep command 
## The spaces will be matched
## The | = OR
## grep does partial matching
## grepl returns TRUE/FALSE, as.numeric converts this to 1/0
classRaw$math_flag <- as.numeric(grepl("GEOM|ALGEBRA|MATH|STAT|CALC|TRIG", 
                                        classRaw$course_code_desc))

## Check the results of flagging your variables
table(classRaw$course_code_desc, classRaw$math_flag)

## Repeat this process for flagging ELA courses
classRaw$ela_flag <- NA
classRaw$ela_flag <- as.numeric(grepl("ENG|ELA", 
                                        classRaw$course_code_desc))

## Check the results of flagging your variables
table(classRaw$course_code_desc, classRaw$ela_flag)
```

#### Step 4: Drop any unneeded variables and drop duplicates

```{r dropCleanSaveClassData}
## Drop the course_code_desc, as it is no longer needed.
classRaw %<>% select(-course_code_desc)

## Collapse the data
classRaw %<>% distinct()

## Verify that the data is unique by cid, and also unique by school year, 
## school code, section code and course code.
nrow(classRaw) == nvals(classRaw$cid)

classRaw %>% distinct(school_year, school_code, 
                      section_code, course_code) %>% 
  nrow == nrow(classRaw)

```

#### Part II: Clean the Student_Class_Enrollment file

#### Step 0: Load the Student_Class_Enrollment data file

This was done above simultaneously with the class file.

#### Step 1: Merge on the temporary Class file you saved earlier to the Student_Class_Enrollment file

In R you can merge two datasets using the familiar language of SQL and joins. 
`inner_join` tells R to retain only observations matched between both datasets.

```{r mergeClassandEnrollFiles}
## Merge classRaw and stuclass together
## keep only files merged from both files
stuclass <- inner_join(stuclass, classRaw, by = "cid")
```


#### Step 2: Evaluate course marks

```{r courseGrades}
## Evaluate course marks
table(stuclass$final_grade_mark, stuclass$credits_possible)
table(stuclass$final_grade_mark, stuclass$final_grade_mark_num)

```

Some letter marks (NGPA and P) indicate that they do not count toward GPA, so 
you may leave the numeric mark as missing.

#### Step 3: Evaluate course completion

```{r courseCompletion}
## Evaluate course completion
## Drop observations that have no record of course completion
stuclass %<>% filter(!is.na(final_grade_mark) & 
                       !is.na(final_grade_mark_num) & 
                       !is.na(credits_earned))

```

#### Step 4: Evaluate course enrollment

```{r courseEnrollment}
## Evaluate course enrollment

## Fix cases where a student has multiple observations for the same course 
## with the same year and marking period (i.e. with overlapping enrollment dates)

# Remove enrollment and withdrawal dates that are not in the current school year.
library(lubridate) # handle dates and times in R correctly
stuclass$school_start <- mdy(paste0("08", "01", stuclass$school_year-1))
stuclass$school_end <- mdy(paste0("07", "31", stuclass$school_year))

stuclass$class_enrollment_date[stuclass$class_enrollment_date < 
                                 stuclass$school_start | 
                                 stuclass$class_enrollment_date > 
                                 stuclass$school_end] <- NA
stuclass$class_withdrawal_date[stuclass$class_withdrawal_date < 
                                 stuclass$school_start | 
                                 stuclass$class_withdrawal_date > 
                                 stuclass$school_end] <- NA
stuclass %<>% select(-school_start, -school_end)

# Check for correct changes
stuclass %>% filter(sid == 2251 & cid == 78150780) %>% 
  select(sid, cid, school_code, school_year, class_enrollment_date, 
         class_withdrawal_date)

# Identify the variables that identify a course
local_ids <- c("sid", "cid", "school_year", "marking_period")

## Populate all enrollments with the earliest enrollment date
stuclass %<>% ungroup %>% 
  group_by(sid, cid, school_year, marking_period) %>% 
  arrange(class_enrollment_date) %>%
  mutate(first_enroll = min(class_enrollment_date, na.rm=TRUE)) 

## TODO: Is this bug real? I do not think so.
# There is a bug here in the enrollment date
# If you use group_by_ and mutate without the underscore
# in a pipe, and then calculate max or min of a date, you 
# get the wrong time

stuclass$class_enrollment_date <- stuclass$first_enroll
stuclass %<>% select(-first_enroll)

stuclass %>% ungroup %>% filter(sid == 2251 & cid == 78150780) %>% 
  select(sid, cid, school_code, school_year, class_enrollment_date, 
         class_withdrawal_date)

## Populate all enrollments with the latest withdrawal date

stuclass %<>% ungroup %>% 
  arrange(sid, cid, school_year, marking_period, class_withdrawal_date) %>%
  group_by(sid, cid, school_year, marking_period) %>% 
  mutate(last_withdraw = max(class_withdrawal_date, na.rm=TRUE))

stuclass %>% ungroup %>% filter(sid == 2251 & cid == 78150780) %>% 
  select(sid, cid, class_enrollment_date, 
         class_withdrawal_date, last_withdraw)

stuclass$class_withdrawal_date <- stuclass$last_withdraw
stuclass$last_withdraw <- NULL

stuclass %>% ungroup %>% filter(sid == 2251 & cid == 78150780) %>% 
  select(sid, cid, school_code, school_year, marking_period, 
         section_code, class_enrollment_date, 
         class_withdrawal_date, class_withdrawal_date)

```

#### Step 5: Drop any unneeded variables, drop duplicates, and save the file

```{r dropCleanSaveCourseEnroll}
## Drop any unneeded variables, drop duplicates, and save the file
## Drop duplicate values
stuclass %<>% ungroup %>% distinct()

## Verify that the file is unique by sid and cid
nrow(stuclass) == nvals(paste0(stuclass$sid, stuclass$cid, sep ="_"))

##  Order the variables

stuclass %<>% select(sid, cid, school_year, school_code, course_code,
                     marking_period, section_code, instructional_level,
                     credits_possible, math_flag, ela_flag,
                     class_enrollment_date, class_withdrawal_date,
                     final_grade_mark, final_grade_mark_num, 
                     credits_earned)
## Sort the data
stuclass %<>% ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(sid, school_year, marking_period, cid)

## Save the current file as Student_Class_Enrollment_Merged.dta.
## Make directory and save

# dir.create("clean")
# save(stuclass, file = "clean/Student_Class_Enrollment_Merged.rda")
## Or if you want to save the Stata file
# write_dta(stuclass, file = "clean/Student_Class_Enrollment_Merged.dta")
```


## Task 7 STUDENT NSC ENROLLMENT

### PURPOSE

In **Task 7:** `Student NSC Enrollment`, you will take the 
`Student_NSC_Enrollment` file that matches the specification in Identify and 
produce a `Student_NSC_Enrollment_Indicators` file that includes some of the 
first college enrollment indicators you will need for further analysis.

College enrollment data is obtained from the National Student Clearninghouse 
(NSC). NSC matches students from a file your agency sends, including 
student id, student name, high school from where the student graduated, 
graduation date, and some other variables. For more information on the 
NSC matching process and requirements, visit
http://www.studentclearinghouse.org/high_schools/studenttracker

To learn more about cleaning the NSC data and how to use NSC files, consult the 
[NSC Missing Manual](http://capseecenter.org/the-missing-manual-using-national-student-clearinghouse-data-to-track-postsecondary-outcomes/)

The core of this task:

1. Rename the variables typically returned by NSC
2. Format the date values
3. Standardize the variables that reflect the type of college the student enrolls in
4. Create a college graduation indicator
5. Interpret the college enrollment status
6. Identify the first college the student attended

After this task, you will merge the `Student_NSC_Indicators` file onto the 
college-going analysis file from **Connect**. You will use this file and the 
high school graduation variables you will also create in **Connect** to then to 
generate further college-going variables, such as variables that indicating if a
student enrolled in college the fall after graduation, enrolled in college a 
year after graduation, and persisted through subsequent years of college.

### HOW TO START

To begin, open the `Student_NSC_Enrollment` file in R. This file contains data 
on college enrollment and persistence for students in your agency. If you do 
not have R, you can follow the steps of the task by looking at the instructions 
and data snippets we have provided.

If this is your first time attempting **Task 7**, start with the provided input 
file. This file teaches you SDP’s cleaning methodology and allows you to check 
answers from a common dataset.


### DATA DESCRIPTION

The input file, `Student_NSC_Enrollment`, follows the structure of
`Student_NSC_Enrollment` in **Identify** so it is unique by `sid`, 
`college_code_branch`, `enrollment_begin`, and `enrollment_end`. This usually 
equates to a semester. Though the exact structure of the data you receive from
NSC may vary, it will likely look something like this. The aim of this task then 
is to become familiar with the NSC data and start building college enrollment 
outcomes that will be expanded upon in **Connect**.

#### Uniqueness

This dataset matches the specification in Identify and is unique by 
`sid`, `college_code_branch`, `enrollment_begin`, and `enrollment_end`.

#### Clean

#### Step 0: Load the Student_NSC_Enrollment data file

```{r readNSCdata}
## Load the Student_NSC_Enrollment data file
# Read in Stata
library(haven) # required for .dta files
# To read data from a zip file we create a connection to the path of the 
# zip file

tmpfileName <- "raw/Student_NSC_Enrollment.dta"
con <- unz(description = "data/raw.zip", filename = tmpfileName, 
           open = "rb")
stunsc <- read_stata(con) # read data in the data subdirectory
close(con)
glimpse(stunsc)
```

#### Step 1: Rename variables and format them for analysis

```{r renameNSCvars}
## Rename variables and format them for analysis

# Rename variables to indicate that they are NSC variables.
names(stunsc) <- c("sid", "n_record_found_yn", "n_enrollment_begin", 
                   "n_enrollment_end", "n_college_opeid", 
                   "n_college_name", "college_state","yr2_yr4", 
                   "public_private", "n_enrollment_status", 
                   "graduated", "n_degree_date", 
                   "n_enrl_sequence", "degree_title", "major")

# Format the date values as dates.
library(lubridate)
stunsc <- as.data.frame(stunsc)

for(i in c("n_enrollment_begin", "n_enrollment_end", 
           "n_degree_date")){
  stunsc[, i] <- lubridate::ymd(as.character(stunsc[, i]))
}

stunsc %>% filter(sid == 13047) %>%

         n_enrollment_end, n_college_name, yr2_yr4, 
         public_private, n_enrollment_status, graduated)

## Drop missing
stunsc %<>% filter(stunsc$college_state != "")

#### Step 2: Identify first college attended by type (any, 4-year and 2-year) that didn’t result in a withdrawal.

```{r identifyFirstCollege}

#### Step 3: Drop any unneeded variables, and save the file

```{r saveStuNSC}
## Drop the unneeded variables
