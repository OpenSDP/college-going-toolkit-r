## Setting up your R Environment

It is highly recommended that you use the RStudio IDE to interact with R. RStudio 
is a free and open source IDE that is available on all computing platforms. 
RStudio provides a number of features that make working with R more convenient. 

## Getting Help

In R you can get help at any time by simply typing `?` and the command of 
of interest. For example `? summary` will open up the help page for the 
summary function.

If you are not sure of the exact name of a function you can use `??` to search 
through the help files available in your R installation. For example `?? model` 
will search for all files that reference the term model. 

## Inserting Comments

In R the `#` character is used to denote a comment. It is useful to insert 
frequent comments that describe what your code is doing. 

Anything the follows a `#` character will be ignored by R until the next 
linebreak. To make a block of comments use the following:

```
# Commenting one line

### Starting a block of comments
### The spacing makes it clear
### Being consistent is key

```

## Breaking Up Long Lines of Code

If a code is long, it can be practical to break it into multiple lines. 
In R there is no need to specifically tell R that code continues on the 
next line. If you use the RStudio IDE it will assist you in making appropriate 
linebreaks. 

## Quotes

R recognizes both `'single'` and `"double"` quotes. At times it may also be 
necessary to use both types of quotes together, such as when passing a string 
that contains a command that operates on a string. 

```
eval(parse(text=("summary(mtcars['Valiant', ])")))
```

# 1. Data Management

## 1.1 Handling Datasets

Working directories are the number one source of confusion for new R users. 
If you use RStudio and RStudio Projects you can eliminate a lot of confusion 
and hassle with setting and changing working directories. 

To view and set th working directory use:

`getwd()` to view the current working directory
`setwd("C:\MyProject")` to set the working directory to "MyProject"

To remove an object from the R workspace:

`rm(object)` 

R can read a variety of data files. R can store files in a native file format 
using either the `.rda` or `.RData` extension. To use files of this type: 

`load('mydata.rda')`

To read in data in other formats you will likely want an external library. For 
data from other statistical software, the `haven` package is excellent at 
reading and writing these files and has the greatest compatibility. 

```
library(haven)
mydata <- read_stata(file = "MyStataFile.dta") 
```

For tabular data the `readr` package is fast and easy to use. 

```
library(readr)
mydata <- read_csv(file = "MyCSVfile.csv")
```

Note that when reading in data you must tell R what name you will assign this 
data in the workspace. This is because R allows you to read in multiple data 
files simultaneously unlike many other common statistical software packages. Try 
to use a short and meaningful name for your data.

R can read Excel files directly through a variety of packages (readxlr, readxls), 
but if possible it is usually preferred to use Excel to convert these to CSV first.

You can also load data directly from a remote data source. R can connect to 
many external data stores directly. ODBC connections are very common. To connect 
to an ODBC connection

```
library(RODBC)

```

Combining datasets in R is easy. You can load multiple datasets into the workspace 
simultaneously and combine them in a variety of ways using common values between 
them. 

The simplest syntax for merging comes from the `dplyr` package which uses a 
command structure similar to SQL. 

- `inner_join` does a 1 to 1 merge 
- `full_join` does a many to many merge
- `left_join` does a one to many merge
- `right_join` does a many to one merge

## 1.2 Structuring Datasets

Collapsing data in R is achieved best by using the `group_by` and `summarize` 
commands in the `dplyr` package.
