## Setting up your R Environment

It is highly recommended that you use the RStudio IDE to interact with R. RStudio 
is a free and open source IDE that is available on all computing platforms. 
RStudio provides a number of features that make working with R more convenient. 

## Getting Help

In R you can get help at any time by simply typing `?` and the command of 
of interest. For example `? summary` will open up the help page for the 
summary function.

If you are not sure of the exact name of a function you can use `??` to search 
through the help files available in your R installation. For example `?? model` 
will search for all files that reference the term model. 

## Inserting Comments

In R the `#` character is used to denote a comment. It is useful to insert 
frequent comments that describe what your code is doing. 

Anything the follows a `#` character will be ignored by R until the next 
linebreak. To make a block of comments use the following:

```
# Commenting one line

### Starting a block of comments
### The spacing makes it clear
### Being consistent is key

```

## Breaking Up Long Lines of Code

If a code is long, it can be practical to break it into multiple lines. 
In R there is no need to specifically tell R that code continues on the 
next line. If you use the RStudio IDE it will assist you in making appropriate 
linebreaks. 

## Quotes

R recognizes both `'single'` and `"double"` quotes. At times it may also be 
necessary to use both types of quotes together, such as when passing a string 
that contains a command that operates on a string. 

```
eval(parse(text=("summary(mtcars['Valiant', ])")))
```




This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
