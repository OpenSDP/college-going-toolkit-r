## B Ninth to Tenth Grade Transition by On-Track Status

## Task 1 Proportion of Students On-Track at the End of Ninth Grade by High School

Purpose: This analysis illustrates what percent of students are on-track after ninth grade graduate
from each high school and the agency as a whole. Different levels of on-track for graduation are distinguished
by high school.

Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions: Keep students in ninth
grade cohorts you can observe graduating high school on time
AND are part of the on-track sample (attended the first semester
of ninth grade and never transferred into or out of the system).

Ask Yourself
- How does the percent of students on-track differ by high school (consider the overall height of each
bar)?
- How does the percent of students on-track for an advanced versus general diploma differ by high
school (consider the different components of each bar)?

Possible Next Steps or Action Plans: Overall school-level results can be disaggregated by student
subgroups of interest, (race, FRPL status, and eighth grade academic achievement).

Analytic Technique:Calculate the proportion of students on-track at each school, and across the
agency.

## Task 2: Ninth To Tenth Grade Transition by On-Track Status

Purpose: This analysis explores how on-track status after ninth grade (the horizontal axis) predicts ontrack
status in tenth grade (the vertical axis). This analysis is useful for developing early dropout warning
indicators for at-risk students as early as the second semester of ninth grade.

Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions: Keep students in ninth
grade cohorts you can observe graduating high school on time
AND are part of the on-track sample (attended the first semester
of ninth grade and never transferred into or out of the system).

Ask Yourself
- What percent of those in a specific on-track category at the end of ninth grade stay in that same
on-track category? For example, what percent of off-track ninth graders continue off-track in tenth
grade?
- How might you use an early warning system to help students get back on-track for graduation?

Possible Next Steps or Action Plans: Identify additional risk factors, (chronic absenteeism, prior
academic achievement etc.) which can be incorporated into analyses like the one above. This could be
used to further understand which students struggle, why they struggle, and interventions to keep them
enrolled and engaged.

# C. High School Graduation

Purpose: This analysis explores variation in high school completion rates across 
high schools in the system for both on-time and late high school graduates.

Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions: Keep students in ninth
grade cohorts you can observe graduating high school one year late

Ask Yourself
- Does the ordering of high school completion rates coincide with beliefs key 
stakeholders have about these high schools?
- Which high schools have the highest and lowest completion rates? Do you know 
why?

## Task 3: High SChool Completion Rates by 8TH Grade Achievement Quartiles


Purpose: This analysis examines variation in completion rates for high schools 
among students with 8th grade test scores in the same quartile. The analysis is useful to explore high school completion
rates across schools with students in the same quartile or range of achievement. Each high school is
repeated as a blue bar in each quartile.

Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:
â€¢ Keep students in ninth grade cohorts you can observe
graduating high school AND have non-missing eighth grade
math scores.
â€¢ Drop high schools with less than 20 students in each quartile
enrolled in ninth grade across the cohorts.

Ask Yourself
â€¢ Looking at the average in each quartile (orange bars), how do 8th grade test scores relate to high
school graduation?
â€¢ For each quartile of 8th grade test scores (the blue bars), how do graduation rates vary by high
school? What is the difference between top and bottom high schools in each quartile?

Possible Next Steps or Action Plans: Highlight comparison schools to show variation across quartiles
and explore reasons why students at different schools, but with similar academic profiles at high
school entry, are more or less likely to graduate.

## Task 4: Racial Gaps in Completion Overall and by 8th Grade Achievement Quartiles

Purpose: This analysis displays an overall graduation gap by race, and examines the extent to which
this gap is explained by average differences in academic achievement between racial sub-groups at
high school entry. The analysis is useful to diagnose whether racial gaps in high school result from
persistent academic achievement gaps that emerge in early grades, or if other factors unique to the
high school experience drive high school completion rate differences by race.


Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:
â€¢ Keep students in ninth grade cohorts you can observe
graduating high school AND have non-missing eighth grade
math scores.
â€¢ Drop any race/ethnic sub-groups with at least 20 students
in each quartile (for the second graph). You may further
restrict the sample to only include students from the most
representative racial/ethnic sub-groups in your agency.

Ask Yourself
â€¢ How do racial gaps in graduation rates change after prior achievement is accounted for? Do these
gaps change for different prior achievement quartiles?

Possible Next Steps or Action Plans: Repeat analyses for only students that qualify for free or reduced
price lunch (FRPL) to explore if racial gaps are better explained by disparities in prior academic
achievement and family socioeconomic status.

## Task 5: Enrollment Outcome in Year Four By On-Track Status At the End of Ninth Grade

Purpose: This analysis explores how strongly student performance in ninth grade predicts high school
graduation three years later. Building upon our analysis of the relationship between student performance
in ninth and tenth grade, the analysis assesses the utility of using course-level performance
data early in studentsâ€™ high school careers to assess risk of non-completion, and target students in
need of academic and/or socio-emotional support.

Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:
â€¢ Keep students in ninth grade cohorts you can observe
graduating high school AND are part of the on-track sample
(attended the first semester of ninth grade and never transferred
into or out of the system).

Ask Yourself
â€¢ How does on-track status at the end of ninth grade relate to high school completion status at the
end of four years?

Possible Next Steps or Action Plans: Repeat analyses for only students that qualify for free or reduced
price lunch (FRPL) to explore whether racial gaps are better explained by disparities in prior academic
achievement and family socioeconomic status.

# D: College Enrollment

The following three analyses in College Enrollment include the three Strategic Performance Indicators
(SPIs) SDP has released to provide deeper insight into the college-going performance of educational
systems. These SPIs were conducted using data from a number of SDP's partner agencies. This
section of Analyze will help you conduct these analyses yourself. You can read more about the SPIs at
http://www.gse.harvard.edu/sdp/strategic-performance-indicators.


## Task 1: College Enrollment Rates by High School

Purpose: This analysis provides an agency snapshot of college enrollment to understand how patterns
of college-going for high school graduates vary across high schools. By illuminating the extent
to which enrollment varies by entry time for seamless enrollers and college level (2- vs. 4-year), the
analysis helps diagnose compositional differences for the college-bound population by high school attended.

Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:
â€¢ Keep students in high school graduation cohorts you can
observe enrolling in college the fall after graduation.
â€¢ Drop any high schools with less than 20 students in the
sample.
â€¢ Include only graduates who received regular or advanced
diplomas (i.e. exclude students who received SPED diplomas
and other certificates).

Ask Yourself
â€¢ How do college enrollment rates differ by high schools? Why might certain schools have a greater
percentage of high school graduates enrolling in college? Do certain schools have higher percentages
of 2-year or delayed college enrollers?

Possible Next Steps or Action Plans: Replicate this analysis to include all first-time ninth graders (i.e.
ninth grade cohorts) in place of graduates. Additionally, create individual high school reports that provide
more details for school administrators (top enrolling institutions of the schoolâ€™s graduates).

### Task 2: Seamless and Delayed College Enrollment Rates by High School

Purpose: This analysis provides an agency snapshot of college enrollment to understand how patterns
of college-going for high school graduates vary across high schools. By illuminating the extent
to which enrollment varies by entry time (seamless vs. delayed) and college level (2- vs. 4-year), the
analysis helps diagnose compositional differences for the college-bound population by high school attended.

Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:
â€¢ Keep students in high school graduation cohorts you can
observe enrolling in college the fall after graduation.
â€¢ Drop any high schools with less than 20 students in the
sample.
â€¢ Include only graduates who received regular or advanced
diplomas (i.e. exclude students who received SPED diplomas
and other certificates).

Ask Yourself
â€¢ How do college enrollment rates differ by high schools? Why might certain schools have a greater
percentage of high school graduates enrolling in college? Do certain schools have higher percentages
of 2-year or delayed college enrollers?

Possible Next Steps or Action Plans: Replicate this analysis to include all first-time ninth graders (i.e.

### Task 3: College Enrollment Rates by Average 8th Grade Achievement

Purpose: This analysis displays variations in college enrollment rates across high schools by
examining the extent to which academic achievement at high school entry explains variation in
college-going across high schools. This analysis is useful to identify high schools with similar
incoming student achievement profiles but divergent college enrollment rates; or on the other hand,
high schools with similar college-going rates but different academic performance at high school entry.

Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:
â€¢ Keep students in high school graduation cohorts you can observe
enrolling in college the fall after graduation AND have
non-missing eighth grade test scores.
â€¢ Include only graduates who received regular or advanced
diplomas (i.e. exclude students who received SPED diplomas
and other certificates).

Ask Yourself
â€¢ What might explain variation in college enrollment rates for high schools with similar incoming
achievement? What might explain variation in incoming achievement for high schools with similar
college enrollment rates?

## Task 4: College Enrollment Rates by 8th Grade Achievement Quartiles

Purpose: This analysis explores whether variation in college enrollment across high schools is similar
among low-, middle, and top-achieving students. It also considers whether overall variation across
schools derives from concentrated divergence among students scoring in a particular achievement
range. Additionally, the analysis facilitates granular school-to-school comparisons to identify those
especially under-, or over-performing within each achievement quartile. Finally, the analysis also helps
identify which student subgroups require additional resources and support within each school.

Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:
â€¢ Keep students in high school graduation cohorts you can observe
enrolling in college the fall after graduation AND have
non-missing eighth grade test scores.
â€¢ Drop high schools with less than 20 students in each quartile
enrolled in ninth grade across the cohorts.
â€¢ Keep only graduates who received regular or advanced diplomas
(i.e. exclude students who received SPED diplomas
and other certificates).

Ask Yourself
â€¢ After looking at the average in each quartile (the orange bars), how do 8th grade test scores
relate to college enrollment? Within each quartile of 8th grade test scores (the blue bars), how do
enrollment rates vary by high school? What is the difference between top and bottom performing
high schools in each quartile?

Possible Next Steps or Action Plans: Repeat this analysis to include all first-time ninth graders (i.e.
ninth grade cohorts) in place of graduates, and explore college enrollment within two years of high
school completion. Additionally, replicate this analysis to explore the relationship between college
enrollment and studentsâ€™ ELA achievement at high school entry. Consider why schools with similar
incoming student profiles may report dramatically different college-going rates. Conversely, consider
why schools with distinct student bodies may report similar matriculation rates to college.
