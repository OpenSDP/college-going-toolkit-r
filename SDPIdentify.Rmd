# IDENTIFY: DATA SPECIFICATION GUIDE

## Introduction

Identify: Data Specification Guide is a resource to identify data elements
required to analyze student achievement, postsecondary attainment, and teacher
effectiveness data. To address these different areas, we organize data elements
into research files that contain important information at the student-, school-,
and teacher- levels. These research files comprise the elements needed to Clean,
Connect, and then Analyze your data.


Data File     | Description     | College Going      | page
------------- | ------------ | -------------  | ------------
Row           | Observation  | Row or record  | Object
Column        | Variable     | Column         | Field or attribute
Variable      | Macro        | Variable       | Variable

In other systems enrollment dates are recorded at the beginning of each school year
