# IDENTIFY: DATA SPECIFICATION GUIDE

## Introduction

Identify: Data Specification Guide is a resource to identify data elements
required to analyze student achievement, postsecondary attainment, and teacher
effectiveness data. To address these different areas, we organize data elements
into research files that contain important information at the student-, school-,
and teacher- levels. These research files comprise the elements needed to Clean,
Connect, and then Analyze your data.


Data File     | Description     | College Going      | page
------------- | ------------ | -------------  | ------------
Row           | Observation  | Row or record  | Object
Column        | Variable     | Column         | Field or attribute
Variable      | Macro        | Variable       | Variable

## Advice on Collecting Your Data

If you gather your agency's data to work through the toolkit (rather than using 
the practice files) use these **"5 Ws of Data Collection"** to guide your efforts:


\begin{tabular}{p{.15\linewidth} p{.15\linewidth} p{.15\linewidth} 
p{.15\linewidth}  p{.15\linewidth} }
\textbf{WHY}  & \textbf{WHAT} & \textbf{WHEN} &
\textbf{WHERE} & \textbf{WHO} \\ 

am I collecting data? & data are needed to answer these questions? & 
(over what date range) do I need data for? & are the data stored? & 
owns the systems where the data live and is responsible for delivery of the data? 
\\ 

What research questions am I trying to answer? & & How reliable are historical 
data? &  & \\ 

\end{tabular}


## The Role of Database Architects

Database Architects play an important role equipping educational analysts and
data strategists with data. SDP recognizes that education agencies have
pre-established systems to collect and manage student-, teacher- and human
resource- databases. This toolkit enables database architects to pull data
available in pre-existing warehouses and transform it for analytic work. 
Database architects should feel free to modify the data specification to meet
their individual agencyâ€™s needs. However, to support analysts and data
strategists interested in pursuing the rest of the SDP Toolkit, following the
standards set in this specification will promote efficiencies in the way
variables are coded and defined.
