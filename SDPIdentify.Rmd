# IDENTIFY: DATA SPECIFICATION GUIDE

## Introduction

Identify: Data Specification Guide is a resource to identify data elements
required to analyze student achievement, postsecondary attainment, and teacher
effectiveness data. To address these different areas, we organize data elements
into research files that contain important information at the student-, school-,
and teacher- levels. These research files comprise the elements needed to Clean,
Connect, and then Analyze your data.


Data File     | Description     | College Going      | page
------------- | ------------ | -------------  | ------------
Row           | Observation  | Row or record  | Object
Column        | Variable     | Column         | Field or attribute
Variable      | Macro        | Variable       | Variable

\textbf{Variable Name}  & \textbf{Values or Data Type} & \textbf{Definition} &
\textbf{Importance} & \textbf{Notes} \\ \hline
sid  & numeric & Student identifier unique to each student. This identification 
number is typically assigned to students upon enrollment in your agency. State 
agencies may have different identification numbers than district agencies for 
the same student. & 5 Cannot be Missing & No Notes. \\ \hline
male & 
\begin{itemize} \setlength\itemsep{-2pt}
\item[] 0 = female
\item[] 1 = male
\end{itemize} & Student gender & 4 Absolutely Necessary. & \\ \hline

\textbf{race\_ethnicity} & 
\begin{itemize} \setlength\itemsep{-2pt}
\item[] 1 = African American
\item[] 2 = Asian American
\item[] 3 = Hispanic
\item[] 4 = American Indian
\item[] 5 = White, not Hispanic
\item[] 6 = Other
\item[] 7 = Multiple
\end{itemize} & 
Student race and ethnicity. For systems where race and ethnicity are treated as a combined variable.
& 4 Absolutely Necessary & 

Use either the race\_ethnicity combined variable, or separate ethnicity and 
race variables 

If the system allows the indication of multiple categories simultaneously 
(e.g., African American and white) report ``multiple'' \\ \hline
