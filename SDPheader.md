## Overview

Housed at the Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard University, the 
Strategic Data Project (SDP) partners with school districts, school networks, 
and state agencies across the US. **Our mission is to transform the use of 
data in education to improve student achievement.** We believe that with the 
right people, the right data, and the right analyses, we can significantly 
improve the quality of strategic policy and management decisions. 

### Core Strategies
To achieve our mission, SDP pursues three core strategies: 

1. Placing top-notch analytic leaders as ``Fellows'' for two years with our 
partner agencies; 
\noindent{\small SDP supports more than 40 Data and Agency Fellows serving 
partner educational agencies -- districts, states, and charter management 
organizations--across the nation.  This number will grow to nearly 70 in 2012.} 

2. Conducting rigorous diagnostic analyses of teacher effectiveness and 
college-going success using existing agency data; and 

\noindent{\small We have completed diagnostics in teacher effectiveness 
and / or college-going success in seven districts, with more diagnostics 
currently underway or planned in additional district 
and state partner agencies.} 

3. Disseminating our tools, methods, and lessons learned to many more education 
agencies. 

\noindent{\small Through the diagnostic analyses, we have developed a body of 
knowledge around effective data use.  The release of this toolkit reflects SDP's 
third core strategy to spread knowledge and build capacity within educational 
agencies for effective data use.} 


### SDP DIAGNOSTICS

Our second core strategy, conducting rigorous diagnostic analyses using existing 
agency data, focuses on two core areas: **(1) college-going success and 
attainment for students and (2) human capital** (primarily examining teacher 
effectiveness).

The diagnostics are a set of analyses that frame actionable questions for 
education leaders.  By asking questions such as, 
*How well do students transition to postsecondary education?* or 
*How successfully is an agency recruiting effective teachers?* we support 
education leaders to develop a deep understanding of student achievement in 
their agency. In an effort to make these analyses accessible and more widely 
used, this toolkit helps analysts collect data and produce analyses associated 
with the SDP College-Going and Human Capital diagnostics. 

Notably, the diagnostic analyses in this release of our toolkit are specific to 
the College-Going diagnostic.  The data collection (Identify), data cleaning 
(Clean), and best practices (Adopt) stages of the toolkit, however, are 
applicable to either diagnostic and convey general data use guidelines valuable 
to any analysts interested in increasing the quality and rigor of their analyses. 
Later releases will address the analyses in our Human Capital diagnostic.
